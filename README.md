1943Colosuss

Colossus was the world's first programmable electronic digital computer. British codebreakers used Colossus to help to read German coded radio messages during World War II.

These messages were sent between the German High Command, and Adolf Hitler's top army commanders. Reading these messages helped the Allies to win the war.

Codebreaker Max Newman worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. His problem was how to get a machine that would help turn German coded radio teleprinter messages into ordinary language. A group of Post Office telephone engineers led by Tommy Flowers worked out how to do this. Their design, which was called "Colossus" used many vacuum tubes (valves). The first machine, Mark 1, worked in December 1943. It solved its first problem at Bletchley Park on 5 February 1944. Colossus Mark 2 was even better. It first worked on 1 June 1944, just before the Normandy Landings on D-Day. Ten Colossus computers were in use at the end of the war.
